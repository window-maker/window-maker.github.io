<section id="enabling-languages-support">
<h1>
<span class="sectnum">1</span> Enabling Languages support</h1>
<p>WINDOW MAKER has the possibility to be translated in many languages, but by
default none of them will be installed, and the support for translation will
not be compiled.</p>
<p>To enable the translation capabilities, you have to specify which language(s)
you want to be installed: this is done with the variable <span class="docutils literal">LINGUAS</span> when
running the <span class="docutils literal">configure</span> script. This variable should contain the
space-separated list of languages you want to install.</p>
<p>You could for instance enable both French (<span class="docutils literal">fr</span>) and Dutch (<span class="docutils literal">nl</span>) with
this:</p>
<pre class="code console highlight literal-block"><code><span class="gp">$ </span>./configure <span class="nv">LINGUAS</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s2">"fr nl"</span></code></pre>
<p>You can of course add any other option that you want to the <span class="docutils literal">configure</span>
command. From the moment you specify the variable, the <span class="docutils literal">configure</span> script
will check that you have the appropriate dependencies for this (basically the
<span class="docutils literal">gettext</span> function and the <span class="docutils literal">libintl</span> library); when you run <span class="docutils literal">make</span> to
compile the project, it will also compile the translation (<span class="docutils literal">mo</span> files) for
the language(s) you asked (if available, of course), and during <span class="docutils literal">make install</span> it will install them in the usual directory.</p>
<p>The installation directory can be changed with the standard option
<span class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">--localedir</span></span> to the <span class="docutils literal">configure</span> script, the default path being
<span class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">PREFIX/share/locale/&lt;lang&gt;/LC_MESSAGES</span></span>).</p>
<section id="getting-the-list-of-supported-languages">
<h2>
<span class="sectnum">1.1</span> Getting the list of supported languages</h2>
<p>The naming convention for the languages follows the <span class="docutils literal">ISO <span class="pre">639-1</span></span> standard, for
which you can find a summary list in the <a class="reference external" href="https://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/manual/html_node/Usual-Language-Codes.html">GNU gettext manual</a>.</p>
<p>But as WINDOW MAKER does not support all of them, the <span class="docutils literal">configure</span> script will
print a warning for each language you specify that it does not know, and sum up
at the end the list of enabled languages that will be installed.</p>
<p>There is a non-standard possibility to set <span class="docutils literal">LINGUAS</span> to <span class="docutils literal">list</span>, in which
case the <span class="docutils literal">configure</span> script will provide you the list of languages it
supports, and stop:</p>
<pre class="code console highlight literal-block"><code><span class="go">./configure LINGUAS="list"</span></code></pre>
<p>There is also another non-standard possibility to enable all the languages that
WINDOW MAKER supports by setting <span class="docutils literal">LINGUAS</span> to <span class="docutils literal">*</span>. This is an internal
trick implemented so the development team can have the command <span class="docutils literal">make distcheck</span> include some checks on translations:</p>
<pre class="code console highlight literal-block"><code><span class="go">./configure LINGUAS='*'</span></code></pre>
</section>
<section id="translations-for-menus">
<h2>
<span class="sectnum">1.2</span> Translations for Menus</h2>
<p>In order to propose an <em>Application Menu</em> (also called <em>Root Menu</em>) that is
also translated in the language of the interface, WINDOW MAKER implements two
complementary mechanisms:</p>
<p>The first, always enabled when i18n support is enabled, is to look for the menu
file containing the name of the locale. For example, if the file is called
<span class="docutils literal">menu</span> and the language is set as <span class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">LANG=fr_FR.utf-8</span></span>, then WINDOW MAKER
will search for, and use the first match found:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><span class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">menu.fr_FR.utf-8</span></span></p></li>
<li><p><span class="docutils literal">menu.fr_FR</span></p></li>
<li><p><span class="docutils literal">menu.fr</span></p></li>
<li><p><span class="docutils literal">menu</span></p></li>
</ul>
<p>The second possibility, which is not enabled by default, is to be able to use a
custom <span class="docutils literal">po</span> file which contains the translations for the text of the menu.
This feature is enabled at compile time, using the option
<span class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">--with-menu-textdomain</span></span> to the <span class="docutils literal">configure</span> script. For example, if you
specify:</p>
<pre class="code console highlight literal-block"><code><span class="go">./configure --with-menu-textdomain=WMMenu</span></code></pre>
<p>then the translations for the menu will be searched in the file <span class="docutils literal">WMMenu.mo</span>
located at the standard location, the default path being
<cite>PREFIX/share/locale/[lang]/LC_MESSAGES/WMMenu.mo</cite>.</p>
<p>If you do not enable the feature (the default behaviour, or with an explicit
<span class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">--without-menu-textdomain</span></span>), then WINDOW MAKER will <strong>not</strong> try to translate
the strings, even using its own domain file (<span class="docutils literal">WindowMaker.mo</span>).</p>
</section>
<section id="setting-linguas-at-system-level">
<h2>
<span class="sectnum">1.3</span> Setting <span class="docutils literal">LINGUAS</span> at system level</h2>
<p>As the variable <span class="docutils literal">LINGUAS</span> is quite standard, you also have the possibility to
set its value in the <span class="docutils literal">config.site</span> file for AUTOCONF. This file can be placed
in one of these paths:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><span class="docutils literal">PREFIX/share/config.site</span></p></li>
<li><p><span class="docutils literal">PREFIX/etc/config.site</span></p></li>
</ul>
<p>This way, the same language list will be used for all the programs that use
AUTOCONF that you would compile. Please note that if you also specify a value
on the command line, it will have precedence over the value in that file.</p>
</section>

<hr class="docutils">
<section id="choosing-the-language">
<h1>
<span class="sectnum">2</span> Choosing the Language</h1>
<p>If you have compiled and installed WINDOW MAKER with support for your language,
the effective translation is done is the very same way as any other application
on an UNIX system, you just have to set the shell variable <span class="docutils literal">LANG</span> to your
language before <span class="docutils literal">wmaker</span> is started. In <span class="docutils literal">sh</span> type of shell (SH, KSH, BASH,
...), this is done for example with (<span class="docutils literal">fr</span> is for French):</p>
<pre class="code console highlight literal-block"><code><span class="go">export LANG=fr</span></code></pre>
<p>There is also a command line option <span class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">--locale</span></span> for WINDOW MAKER which may be
used to set the language:</p>
<pre class="code console highlight literal-block"><code><span class="go">wmaker --locale fr</span></code></pre>
<p>When using this option, WINDOW MAKER will use the locale you specified,
redefining the <span class="docutils literal">LANG</span> environment variable to this value so all program
started from WINDOW MAKER will inherit its value.</p>
<p>If your system is using SYSTEMD, you can also configure the locale at system
level using the command:</p>
<pre class="code console highlight literal-block"><code><span class="go">localectl set-locale LANG=fr</span></code></pre>
<p>You can check if the current value is properly supported with the command:</p>
<pre class="code console highlight literal-block"><code><span class="go">locale</span></code></pre>
<p>If this does not work, you may need first to activate the support for your
locale in the system; you can get the list of currently enabled locales with
the command:</p>
<pre class="code console highlight literal-block"><code><span class="go">locale -a</span></code></pre>
<p>You should be able to enable a new language support by editing the file
<span class="docutils literal">/etc/locale.gen</span> to uncomment the locale(s) you need (by removing the <span class="docutils literal">#</span>
character and space(s) in front of it, and by running the command
<span class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">locale-gen</span></span> as root.</p>
<p>For further information, you may wish to read dedicated documentation, for
example from <a class="reference external" href="http://tldp.org/HOWTO/HOWTO-INDEX/other-lang.html">the Linux Documentation Project</a> or through pages like
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.shellhacks.com/en/HowTo-Change-Locale-Language-and-Character-Set-in-Linux">Shell Hacks' note on Changing Locale</a>.</p>
</section>
<hr class="docutils">
<section id="troubleshooting">
<h1>
<span class="sectnum">3</span> Troubleshooting</h1>
<p>If I18N support does not work for you, check these:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>the <span class="docutils literal">LANG</span> environment variable is set to your locale, and
the locale is supported by your OS's locale or X's locale
emulation. you can display all supported locales by
executing "<span class="docutils literal">locale <span class="pre">-a</span></span>" command if it is available; you
can check if your locale is supported by X's locale emulation,
see <span class="docutils literal">/usr/share/X11/locale/locale.alias</span></p></li>
<li><p>check if you are using an appropriate fonts for the locale you chose. If
you're using a font set that has a different encoding than the one used by
XLIB or LIBC, bad things can happen. Try specifically putting the encoding in
the <span class="docutils literal">LANG</span> variable, like <span class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">ru_RU.KOI8-R</span></span>. Again, see
<span class="docutils literal">/usr/share/X11/locale/locale.alias</span></p></li>
<li>
<p>the fonts you're using support your locale. if your font setting on
<span class="docutils literal">$HOME/GNUstep/Defaults/WindowMaker</span> is like...</p>
<pre class="code ini highlight literal-block"><code><span class="na">WindowTitleFont</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">=</span><span class="w"> </span><s>"Trebuchet MS:bold:pixelsize=12";</s><span class="w">
</span><span class="na">MenuTitleFont</span><span class="w">   </span><span class="o">=</span><span class="w"> </span><s>"Trebuchet MS:bold:pixelsize=12";</s></code></pre>
<p>then you can't display Asian languages (<span class="docutils literal">ja</span>, <span class="docutils literal">ko</span>, <span class="docutils literal">ch</span>, ...)
characters using <span class="docutils literal">Trebuchet MS</span>. A font that is guaranteed to work for any
language is <span class="docutils literal">sans</span> (or <span class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">sans-serif</span></span>). <span class="docutils literal">sans</span> is not a font itself, but
an alias which points to multiple fonts and will load the first in that list
that has the ability to show glyphs in your language. If you don't know a
font that is suited for your language you can always set all your fonts to
something like:</p>
<pre class="code ini highlight literal-block"><code><span class="na">"sans:pixelsize</span><span class="o">=</span><s>12"</s></code></pre>
<p>However, please note that if your font is something like:</p>
<pre class="code ini highlight literal-block"><code><span class="na">"Trebuchet MS,sans serif:pixelsize</span><span class="o">=</span><s>12"</s></code></pre>
<p>this will not be able to display Asian languages if any of the previous fonts
before sans are installed. This is because unlike the proper font pickup that
<span class="docutils literal">sans</span> guarantees for your language, this construct only allows a font
fallback mechanism, which tries all the fonts in the list in order, until it
finds one that is available, even if it doesn't support your language.</p>
<p>Also you need to change font settings in style files in the
<span class="docutils literal">$HOME/Library/WindowMaker/Style</span> directory.</p>
</li>
<li><p>the <span class="docutils literal">LC_CTYPE</span> environment variable is unset or it has the correct value.
If you don't know what is the correct value, unset it.</p></li>
</ul>

<section id="contribute-to-translations">
<h1>
<span class="sectnum">4</span> Contribute to Translations</h1>
<p>You may have noticed that many translations are not up to date, because the
code has evolved but the persons who initially contributed may not have had the
time to continue, so any help is welcome.</p>
<p>Since WINDOW MAKER 0.95.7 there are some targets to <span class="docutils literal">make</span> that can help you
in that task.</p>
<section id="install-the-latest-sources">
<h2>
<span class="sectnum">4.1</span> Install the latest sources</h2>
<p>If you want to contribute, the first step is get the development branch of the code;
this is done using <span class="docutils literal">git</span>. If you do not feel confident at all with using
<span class="docutils literal">git</span>, you may also try to ask for a <em>snapshot</em> on the developer's mailing
list <a class="reference external" href="mailto:wmaker-dev@lists.windowmaker.org">wmaker-dev@lists.windowmaker.org</a>. With <span class="docutils literal">git</span> the procedure is:</p>
<pre class="code bash highlight literal-block"><code><span class="c1"># Get your working copy of the sources
</span>git clone git://repo.or.cz/wmaker-crm.git

<span class="c1"># Go into that newly created directory
</span><span class="nb">cd</span> wmaker-crm

<span class="c1"># Switch to the branch where everything happens
</span>git checkout next

<span class="c1"># Generate the configuration script
</span>./autogen.sh</code></pre>
<p>Now you should have an up-to-date working copy ready to be compiled; you will
not need to go the full way but you should run the <span class="docutils literal">configure</span> script, so it
will create the <span class="docutils literal">Makefile`s</span>, and you may want to compile the code once so it
will not do it again automatically later while you are doing something else:</p>
<pre class="code console highlight literal-block"><code><span class="gp"># </span>Setup the build, enabling at least the language you want to work on
<span class="go">./configure LINGUAS="&lt;list of iso 639 country code&gt;"

</span><span class="gp"># </span>Compile the code once
<span class="go">make</span></code></pre>
</section>
<section id="updating-the-translations">
<h2>
<span class="sectnum">4.2</span> Updating the Translations</h2>
<p>The typical process for translating one program is:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>generate a POT file (PO Template): this is done with <span class="docutils literal">xgettext</span> which
searches for all the strings from the sources that can be translated;</p></li>
<li><p>update the PO file for your language: this is done with <span class="docutils literal">msgmerge</span> which
compares the PO file and aligns it to the latest template;</p></li>
<li><p>edit the new PO file: this is done by you with your favourite editor, to add
the missing <span class="docutils literal">msgstr</span>, review the possible <em>fuzzy matches</em>, …</p></li>
<li><p>check the PO file: unfortunately there is no definitive method for this;</p></li>
<li><p>submit your contribution to the project: this is done with <span class="docutils literal">git</span>.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>In WINDOW MAKER, you have actually 4 <span class="docutils literal">po</span> files to take care of:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><span class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">po/&lt;LANG&gt;.po</span></span>: for WINDOW MAKER itself</p></li>
<li><p><span class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">WPrefs.app/po/&lt;LANG&gt;.po</span></span>: for the Preference Editor program</p></li>
<li><p><span class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">WINGs/po/&lt;LANG&gt;.po</span></span>: for the graphic toolkit library</p></li>
<li><p><span class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">util/po/&lt;LANG&gt;.po</span></span>: for the command-line tools of WINDOW MAKER</p></li>
</ul>
<p>As stated previously, there is a <span class="docutils literal">make</span> target that can help you to
automatically generate the POT and update the PO for these 4 cases:</p>
<pre class="code console highlight literal-block"><code><span class="go">make update-lang PO=&lt;LANG&gt;</span></code></pre>
<p>Once run, it will have updated as needed the 4 <span class="docutils literal">po</span> files against the latest
source code. You may wish to use the command <span class="docutils literal">git gui</span> to view the changes;
you can now edit the files to complete the translation, correct them, remove
deprecated stuff, … Please note that the encoding should be set to <em>UTF-8</em> as
this is now the standard.</p>
<!-- TODO: change mailing list address -->
<p>If you think an error message is too obscure, just ask on the developer mailing
list <a class="reference external" href="mailto:wmaker-dev@lists.windowmaker.org">wmaker-dev@lists.windowmaker.org</a>: in addition to clarifications
there's even a chance for the original message to be improved!</p>
<p>You may find some information on working with <span class="docutils literal">po</span> file in the <a class="reference external" href="https://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/manual/html_node/Editing.html">GNU gettext
documentation</a>.</p>
</section>
<section id="translate-the-man-pages">
<h2>
<span class="sectnum">4.3</span> Translate the Man Pages</h2>
<p>You may want to extend the translation to the documentation that is provided to
users in the form of Unix <em>man pages</em>. The sources of the man pages are located
in the <span class="docutils literal">doc/</span> directory; the translation should be placed in the directory
<span class="docutils literal">doc/LANG/</span> with the same file name.</p>
<!-- TODO: change mailing list address -->
<p>The directory will also need a file <span class="docutils literal">Makefile.am</span> which provides the list of
man pages to be included in the distribution package and to be installed. You
can probably get inspiration from an existing one from another language; if you
do not feel confident about it do not hesitate to ask on the project's mailing
list (<a class="reference external" href="mailto:wmaker-dev@lists.windowmaker.org">wmaker-dev@lists.windowmaker.org</a>), either for help or to ask someone
to make it for you.</p>
<p>Please note that although most man pages sources are directly in man page
format (<em>nroff</em>, the file extension being a number), a few of them are
processed by a script (those with the <span class="docutils literal">.in</span> extension, like <span class="docutils literal">wmaker.in</span>).
This is done because in some case we want the man page to reflect the actual
compilation options.</p>
<p>You may not want to bother with this hassle, in which case you can simply name
your translation file with the <span class="docutils literal">.1</span> and remove the special <span class="docutils literal">@keyword@</span>
marks. If you are sure you want to keep that processing but do not feel
confident about hacking the <span class="docutils literal">Makefile.am</span> do not hesitate to ask on the
project's mailing list (<a class="reference external" href="mailto:wmaker-dev@lists.windowmaker.org">wmaker-dev@lists.windowmaker.org</a>).</p>
</section>
<section id="checking-the-result">
<h2>
<span class="sectnum">4.4</span> Checking the Result</h2>
<p>In the WINDOW MAKER build tree you also have another target that can help you,
it is <span class="docutils literal">make check</span>.</p>
<p>At current time, it does not check much, but if during the <span class="docutils literal">make <span class="pre">update-lang</span></span>
new <span class="docutils literal">po</span> file have been created you may get some errors, because you have to
add these new files to the variable <span class="docutils literal">EXTRA_DIST</span> in the corresponding
<span class="docutils literal">Makefile</span>.</p>
<p>If you do not feel confident about doing it, do not worry, just tell about it
when you submit your work, and some developer on the mailing list will just be
happy to do it for you when integrating your valuable contribution (we always
like when someone helps making WINDOW MAKER better).</p>
</section>
<section id="submitting-your-contribution">
<h2>
<span class="sectnum">4.5</span> Submitting your Contribution</h2>
<p><em>Preliminary Remark</em>: if the update process made changes in a <span class="docutils literal">po</span> file but
you did not change any <span class="docutils literal">msgstr</span> content, it is probably a good idea to not
submit the changes to that <span class="docutils literal">po</span> file because it would just add noise.</p>
<p>When you feel ready to send your changes, the first step is to prepare them.
This is done with <span class="docutils literal">git</span>: if you have not run the <span class="docutils literal">git gui</span> previously then
it is a good time to do it now. This window offers you the possibility to show
your changes and to decide what you want to send.</p>
<p>The window is divided in 4 panes:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>top-right show the current changes you have selected, for review (and also
for cherry-picking stuff if you want to select precisely)</p></li>
<li><p>top-left ("Unstaged Changes") the list of files with changes to be send, you
can click on the name of the file to see the changes, you can click on the
icon of the file if you want to send all the changes in this file; an icon in
blue shows a file that have been changed and an icon in black shows a file
that is new</p></li>
<li><p>bottom-left ("Staged Changes") the list of files with changes that you have
chosen to send so far, you can click on the file name to view these changes,
you can click on the icon if you want to remove the changes from this file
from the list to send</p></li>
<li><p>bottom-right ("Commit Message") the message you want to attach to your
changes when you submit them to the development team</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The idea here is to pick your changes to the <span class="docutils literal">po</span> files; for the <em>commit
message</em> you may wish to stuck to a simple, single line:</p>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">"Updated translations for &lt;LANG&gt;"</div>
</div>
<p>The penultimate step is to click on the button <span class="docutils literal">Sign Off</span> (it will add a line
in the commit message), and then click on the button <span class="docutils literal">Commit</span>. From this
time, the commit message will clear itself and the "Staged Changes" also,
showing that your action was done.</p>
<p>You may now quit the <span class="docutils literal">git gui</span>, the final step begins by running this
command:</p>
<pre class="code console highlight literal-block"><code><span class="go">git format-patch HEAD^</span></code></pre>
<!-- TODO: change mailing list address -->
<p>This will generate a file named like <span class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">0001-updated-translations-for-XX.patch</span></span>
which contains your changes, ready for sending.  The goal will now be to email
this file to <a class="reference external" href="mailto:wmaker-dev@lists.windowmaker.org">wmaker-dev@lists.windowmaker.org</a>.  If you feel confident in having
<span class="docutils literal">git</span> send it for you, you may want to read the file
<span class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">The-perfect-Window-Maker-patch.txt</span></span> to see how to configure <span class="docutils literal">git</span> for
mailing, so you can run:</p>
<pre class="code console highlight literal-block"><code><span class="go">git send-email 0001-updated-translations-for-XX.patch</span></code></pre>
