<p>Window Maker is an X11 window manager originally designed to provide
integration support for the GNUstep Desktop Environment.  In every way
possible, it reproduces the elegant look and feel of the NEXTSTEP[tm] user
interface. It is fast, feature rich, easy to configure, and easy to use. It is
also free software and part of the GNU Project, with contributions being made
by programmers from around the world</p>

<h2>
<span class="sectnum">1.10</span> What is the difference between appicons, mini-windows, and minimized applications?</h2>
<p>Thanks to Jim Knoble for this answer:</p>
<p>Many window managers are capable of turning large windows into smaller <em>icons</em>
which represent the window yet don't take as much screen real estate.  We're
all familiar with that model.</p>
<p>Window Maker has two kinds of these icons. One kind is created when an
application - technically, a window group - is started. It represents the
entire application and is called an <em>appicon</em>. Such icons are square tiles
containing only the picture which represents the application; they have no
titles.</p>
<p>The second kind of icon in Window Maker is created when a particular window
(possibly one belonging to an application displaying more than one window) is
<em>miniaturized</em> (which is the same action as <em>minimizing</em> or <em>iconifying</em> in
other window management models) using the miniaturization button on the
window's titlebar. These miniaturized windows are called <em>miniwindows</em> and can
normally be distinguished from appicons by their small titlebar at the top of
the tile.</p>
</section>
<section id="how-do-i-make-sense-of-window-maker-s-version-number-scheme">
<h2>
<span class="sectnum">1.11</span> How do I make sense of Window Maker's version number scheme?</h2>
<p>The numbering scheme is relatively simple, and is in the format of three
numbers separated by dots. The first number is the "major" revision number.
The second is the "minor" revision number. And finally, the third is the "patch
level" number.</p>
<p>To put this all into perspective, let's examine the version number "0.65.1".
This number signifies that there has not been a major revision release, that
its minor revision is newer than the previous one (0.64.x), and that it's on
the first patch level after the 0.65.0 release. This still might be confusing,
so go away with this in mind: numbers ending in .0 tend to be new feature
releases but less stable than .1, .2, .3 patch level releases, the latter of
which are used to fix bugs.</p>
<p>It is generally safe to go with the highest numbered patch release.</p>

<section id="why-are-no-icons-showing-up-after-installing-window-maker">
<h2>
<span class="sectnum">2.1</span> Why are no icons showing up after installing Window Maker?</h2>
<p>As of WindowMaker version 0.15.0, the default setup includes .tiff icons which
require you to have compiled Window Maker with libtiff support. For assistance
on compiling libtiff, see the following question.</p>
</section>
<section id="how-do-i-make-window-maker-link-against-libtiff">
<h2>
<span class="sectnum">2.2</span> How do I make Window Maker link against libtiff?</h2>
<p>Many UNIX operating systems have difficulty finding third party libraries by
default. Unfortunately, there are too many of these to include instructions for
them all.</p>
<p>In general, you will want to ensure the latest version of libtiff is installed
(see <a class="reference external" href="ftp://www.libtiff.org">ftp://www.libtiff.org</a>). Typically on non-Linux systems, libtiff will be
located under /usr/local, with includes and libs in those respective
sub-directories.</p>
<p>Often, it will be necessary to add /usr/local/lib to the system's
LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable (especially so on Solaris, but see 'man
ld' for details on your platform). Furthermore, it is possible to supply
special flags to the configure script to help it find where the libraries are.
An example is given below:</p>
<pre class="code console highlight literal-block"><code><span class="go">./configure --with-libs-from="-L/usr/local/lib" \
   --with-incs-from="-I/usr/local/include"</span></code></pre>
<p>Also, you will want to make sure you're using GNU make (gmake) for the Window
Maker compile.</p>

<section id="how-do-i-switch-cde-s-window-manager-to-use-windowmaker">
<h2>
<span class="sectnum">2.3</span> How do I switch CDE's window manager to use WindowMaker?</h2>
<section id="method-1">
<h3>
<span class="sectnum">2.3.1</span> Method 1:</h3>
<p>Peter Ilberg gives us this answer:</p>
<p>Install WM wherever you want it, mine is in /opt/WindowMaker-0.16.0 (eg. use
./configure --prefix=/opt/WindowMaker-0.16.0). Run the install script
wmaker.inst in your home directory.</p>
<p>Add the following two lines to .dtprofile in your home directory:</p>
<pre class="code console highlight literal-block"><code><span class="go">SESSIONTYPE=xdm; export SESSIONTYPE
</span><span class="gp">PATH=:/usr/contrib/bin/X11:$</span>PATH:.<span class="p">;</span> <span class="nb">export</span> PATH</code></pre>
<p>This tells CDE to go looking for an .xinitrc/.xsession instead of using the
default environment.</p>
<p>Make your .xsession/.xinitrc executable (VERY IMPORTANT, wmaker.inst did NOT do
this automatically for me) using eg.</p>
<pre class="code console highlight literal-block"><code><span class="go">chmod ugo+x .xsession</span></code></pre>
<p>Your .xsession/.xinitrc should look something like this:</p>
<pre class="code bash highlight literal-block"><code><span class="ch">#!/bin/sh
</span>
&lt;some other init stuff that you want/need&gt;
<span class="nb">exec</span> wmaker</code></pre>
<p>Things to try if it doesn't work: (somewhat fuzzy and random)</p>
<p>This should do it although I did have problems sometimes initially which I
fixed by randomly trying absolute pathes for wmaker in .xsession/.xinitrc
and/or making the dtprofile/.xinitrc/etc executable. It helps logging in on the
console (select from CDE login screen) and start X manually using "X". If it
works that way it should work when logging into the CDE environment. Remember
to Check your paths!</p>
<p>If it doesn't work, you can also substitute some other window manager for
wmaker in the .xinitrc and see if that works. If it does you know at least that
.xinitrc is getting called/executed, so your WM path is wrong or not set.</p>
</section>
<section id="method-2">
<h3>
<span class="sectnum">2.3.2</span> Method 2:</h3>
<p>Thomas Hanselman gave this alternative answer (via Peter Ilberg):</p>
<p>Build and install WM wherever you want, as described in Method 1. You can
install and run WM just fine from your home directory. That's what I'm doing,
since I don't have root access at work :(. Then, in your Xdefaults file in your
home directory, add the following line:</p>
<pre class="code console highlight literal-block"><code><span class="go">Dtsession*wmStartupCommand: &lt;path to WindowMaker executable&gt;</span></code></pre>
<p>Then, log out, and log back in, and, unless I've forgotten a step (or this is a
custom Nortel thing), you should be in Window Maker heaven ;).</p>
</section>
<section id="difference-between-the-methods-according-to-thomas">
<h3>
<span class="sectnum">2.3.3</span> Difference between the methods: (according to Thomas)</h3>
<p>I've been told that the difference between setting the resource and Peter's
method is that if you override the window manager with the resouce, you still
get the CDE resources read into the resource database (so you still have your
color settings &amp; such from CDE), whereas with Peter's, the CDE resource
don't get read into the database. I don't know if this is true or not, however.
Also, another thing to note with Window Maker and HP-UX 10.20 - if you select
"Exit Session" from the WM root menu, WindowMaker and all of your applications
are killed, but you may not be logged out. Again, this might be an artifact
from my work environment, or the way I start Window Maker.</p>
</section>
<section id="owen-stenseth-adds">
<h3>
<span class="sectnum">2.3.4</span> Owen Stenseth adds:</h3>
<p>When using this method it is possible to exit Window Maker cleanly by using the
dtaction command. I use the following in my Window Maker menu:</p>
<pre class="code highlight literal-block"><code>"Exit Session"      EXEC dtaction ExitSession</code></pre>
<p>The only problem I have at the moment is I seem to get multiple copies of
asclock running when I log in again.</p>

<h2>
<span class="sectnum">2.4</span> Do I need to rerun wmaker.inst with every new version of Window Maker?</h2>
<p>Dan Pascu reveals the answer:</p>
<p>If this is necessary, it will be listed in the NEWS file included in the source
distribution. Since 0.15.x, the domain files have been changed in such a way
that re-running wmaker.inst is redundant. The user config files are by default
merged in with the global ones normally located in
/usr/local/share/WindowMaker/Defaults. So, even if new options are added, they
should be automatically added to the environment.</p>
</section>
<section id="why-am-i-only-getting-a-root-menu-with-xterm-and-exit-items">
<h2>
<span class="sectnum">2.5</span> Why am I only getting a root menu with xterm and exit items?</h2>
<p>Most likely, the problem is that Window Maker can not find a copy of the C pre
processor in a directory such as /lib. The file /lib/cpp should be a symbolic
link to whatever C compiler's cpp you are using. For example:</p>
<pre class="code shell-session highlight literal-block"><code><span class="gp">$ </span>file <span class="sb">`</span>which cpp<span class="sb">`</span>
<span class="go">/usr/bin/cpp link to /usr/bin/cpp-2.95</span></code></pre>
<p>Another possibility is your /usr/X11/lib/X11/xinit/xinitrc is a broken symlink.
Either create a new symlink, or do something like:</p>
<pre class="code shell-session highlight literal-block"><code><span class="gp">$ </span>cp /usr/X11/lib/X11/xinit/xinitrc.fvwm2 <span class="se">\
</span>   /usr/X11/lib/X11/xinit/xinitrc.wmaker
<span class="gp">$ </span>ln -sf /usr/X11/lib/X11/xinit/xinitrc.wmaker <span class="se">\
</span>   /usr/X11/lib/X11/xinit/xinitrc</code></pre>
<p>then just edit /usr/X11/lib/X11/xinit/xinitrc and replace the exec of 'fvwm2'
by '/usr/local/bin/wmaker' (should be somewhere towards the end of the file,
most probably the very last line).</p>

<span class="sectnum">2.6</span> How do I get Window Maker to use more than 16 colors on my SGI Indy Workstation?</h2>
<p>Thanks to Peter H. Choufor this answer:</p>

<section id="using-windowmaker-with-solaris-2-6-cde">
<h2>
<span class="sectnum">2.7</span> Using WindowMaker with Solaris 2.6 CDE</h2>
<p>Thanks to Rob Funk for this answer:</p>
<p>Assuming you installed Window Maker according to the README's that come with
the source, all you need to run Window Maker on a Solaris box is an entry in
the .xinitrc. This should work for any version. When you run wmaker.inst the
first time, allow it to make changes to the .xinitrc file. Mine looks like
this:</p>
<pre class="code sh highlight literal-block"><code><span class="ch">#!/bin/sh
</span><span class="c1"># Window Maker Default .xinitrc
</span><span class="nb">exec</span> /usr/local/bin/wmaker</code></pre>
<p>Believe it or not, that's all that it takes. This, in fact, runs Window Maker
instead of OpenWindows. In order to choose Window Maker, you simply choose
"OpenWindows Desktop" in the "Options - Session" Menus And Choose "CDE Desktop"
if you want CDE.</p>
<p>The color schemes and settings for Window Maker are seperate from CDE. I tested
on a SPARC 10, but I assume Solaris x86 would work also.</p>

<p>Installing Window Maker on a Solaris 2.6 box might require one or two little
hints. Here you are (this was on a system running xdm by the way, but similar
suggestions apply otherwise):</p>
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>/usr/openwin/lib/X11/xdm/Xservers like this:</p>

<pre class="code shell-session highlight literal-block"><code><span class="gp">$ </span>./configure --disable-shm</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p>might have to modify your LD_LIBRARY_PATH:, or make "wmaker" a script that

<pre class="code shell-session highlight literal-block"><code><span class="go">libwraster.so.1: cannot open shared object file</span></code></pre>
<p>These are the instructions for Linux.</p>
<p>First, make sure that /usr/local/lib ( or whatever directory you installed
Window Maker to) is listed in your /etc/ld.so.conf ). You need to run ldconfig
so the new shared libraries will be loaded. After running ldconfig as root, the
linker should properly load the libraries. You need to run this every time you
update Window Maker.</p>
<p>Thanks to Joseph Czapiga, the BSD procedure for adding shared library

<p>You need to install libtool. It also must be a libtool different from version

<p>The newest jpeg libs are availible at <a class="reference external" href="http://www.ijg.org">http://www.ijg.org</a></p>
<p>How many of you have seen that darned "lib reports 62 caller expects 61" type
of error? Here are some answers that will possibly help you out.</p>
<p>First things first. As always, make sure there are not older copies of libjpeg
floating around on your system. ]Some distributions by default come with an old
libjpeg.so.1 in the /usr/X11R6/lib/ directory. This can simply be deleted. Or
if something complains after you delete it, recompile it if you can to look for
the new lib in the right place, or if that fails, as a last resort, you might
add a symlink to the new lib like so:</p>
<pre class="code shell-session highlight literal-block"><code><span class="go">ln -s /usr/local/lib/libjpeg.so.6.0.2 libjpeg.so.1</span></code></pre>
<p>Note that you should use your system's version of ldconfig to properly manage
your library cache (or other appropriate mechanism).</p>
<p>On Linux, this would mean having /usr/local/lib in /etc/ld.so.conf and then
running ldconfig.</p>
<p>Now on to the error. This is basically caused by your application having been
compiled to dynamically use the libjpeg.so shared library. When you install a
new lib and then try to run your program again, it expects the lib it was
compiled against, in this case the older libjpeg.so.6.0.1 and instead finds
libjpeg.so.6.0.2 and reports the error.</p>
<p>The fix is actually rather simple. Along with adding a libjpeg.so.6 symlink
like so (just in case):</p>
<pre class="code shell-session highlight literal-block"><code><span class="go">ln -s libjpeg.so.6.0.2 libjpeg.so.6</span></code></pre>
<p>where you installed your new lib, you simply need to recompile your app too
link it against the new library.</p>
<p>Also, make sure to use GNU make for the Window Maker compile.</p>

<p>Users have had a few problems with giflib... it seems that the install process
didn't install the header file libgif.h, so although the Window Maker configure
found the lib (libgif.so.x), when you actually try to compile, it fails when it
looks for the header to include the make. One solution is to simply copy it
from the libgif source directory to the local system include directory.

<h2>
<span class="sectnum">2.16</span> How do I fix an error similar to "wrlib: could not allocate shared memory segment: invalid argument"</h2>
<p>This relates to a shared memory problem on Solaris. Usually one can't see it -
but it is visible if X is started from command line (or fail-safe session for
that matter). In any of the cases, on the stderr you get an error message like
this:</p>
<pre class="code console highlight literal-block"><code><span class="go">"wrlib: could not allocate shared memory segment: invalid argument"</span></code></pre>
<p>This one is generated by wrlib if Window Maker is compiled with shared-memory
usage enabled (which is the default). The explanation is that Solaris by
default comes with a shared memory segment size of maximum 1 M. What happends
is that if you have a really-really cool(tm) background, it is usually much
bigger than that 1 M segment of shared memory. To see your defaults relating
the IPC settings check the output of the "sysdef" command (look for IPC Shared
Memory). There you should see the maximum allocable size for a shared memory
segment. If it is less than 5 M you should really increase it by adding the
following line in your /etc/system file:</p>
<pre class="code highlight literal-block"><code>set shmsys:shminfo_shmmax=20971520</code></pre>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Make sure you don't already have this value set. If you do, simply increase
the value. In case you have a much bigger value, stick to what you have,
because you should have no problems with it.</p></li>
<li><p>The value allows a maximum segment size of 20 M, which really should be
enough for anyone. If not, try using a smaller background image!</p></li>
<li><p>Make sure you spell the line <em>exactly</em> as shown, otherwise at boot time the
kernel will complain of not finding such a module name and will not set a
thing about it!</p></li>
<li><p>Make sure you don't delete other lines or modify them "beyond recognition",
for evil things may happen at boot time.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>After adding this to your /etc/system you need to reboot in order for the new
limit to take effect. Also, you may want to check the new limit just to make
sure it has been set.</p>

<h2>
<span class="sectnum">3.6</span> How do you dock &lt;insert program here&gt; that doesn't have an appicon in the new version of WindowMaker?</h2>
<p>There is now an option available to emulate appicons so that Window Maker can
dock just about anything now. To dock a misbehaving application, right click on
the title bar and select the attributes menu. Next, select the pull down menu's
"Advanced Options" item. Under the <span class="docutils literal">Advanced Options</span> menu, select the
<span class="docutils literal">Emulate Application Icon</span> Option then Save, Apply and close the dialog.</p>
<p>This should allow you do dock the program normally.</p>
<p>Dan Pascu adds:</p>
<p>Emulate Appicon does exactly the same as dockit. So if Emulate Appicon does not
work, dockit will not work either. For such apps you can do nothing. They are
badly coded (they do not set the instance.class hints). For these Attributes
are also not available, since attributes apply to an instance and/or class
hint.</p>
<p>Note: Dockit was previously distributed with Window Maker and was launched from
the top dock icon.</p>
<p>Elliott Potter adds:</p>
<p>There's another way to dock applications that misbehave ... I've only done this
with a couple of things (Adobe AcroRead is the only one I remember at the
moment).</p>
<p>If Attributes -&gt; Advanced Options -&gt; Emulate Application Icon doesn't work:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Dock another application to the clip, where you want your application to go.
I used gv, but anything you can dock will work.</p></li>
<li><p>Quit WindowMaker</p></li>
<li>
<p>Edit ~/GNUstep/Defaults/WMState.</p>
<p>If you're docking to the clip, scroll down to the Workspaces section.
When you find whatever you docked, you'll see:</p>
<pre class="code highlight literal-block"><code>{
    Command = gv;
    Name = GV.gv;
    AutoLaunch = No;
    Forced = No;
    BuggyApplication = No;
    Position = "6,0"
    Omnipresent = No;
    DropCommand = "gv %d";
},</code></pre>
<p>Edit it to use the info for your new application:</p>
<pre class="code highlight literal-block"><code>{
     Command = acroread;         # use the full pathname if you have to
     Name = acroread.acroread;
     AutoLaunch = No;
     Forced = No;
     BuggyApplication = No;
     Position = "6,0"
     Omnipresent = No;
     DropCommand = "acroread %s";
},</code></pre>
<p>Then edit WMWindowAttributes, and add a line for your application's
icon...you can edit the line that was inserted, or make a new one - I
just make a new one:</p>
<pre class="code highlight literal-block"><code>acroread.acroread = {Icon = pdf.tiff;};</code></pre>
<p>Then re-start WindowMaker, and your icon should be there! You can move it
around like any other docked app now, but the Attributes section still won't
work.</p>

<p>Here is the in depth explanation straight from the NEWS file:</p>
<p>wmsetbg now accepts the following options:</p>
<!-- TODO wow! how old this thing is! -->
<pre class="code highlight literal-block"><code>     usage: wmsetbg [-options] image
     options:
     -d
             dither image

             update &lt;domain&gt; database
     -c &lt;cpc&gt;
             colors per channel to use</code></pre>
<p>By default, it will try to guess if dithering is needed or not and proceed
accordingly. Using -d or -m will force it to dither or match colors.</p>
<p>Dithering for more than 15bpp is generally not needed, and will only result in
a slower processing. Don't use dithering except when needed, because it is
slower. Else rely on wmsetbg which will detect if dithering is needed and use
it.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><span class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">-u</span></span> - will update the WorkspaceBack in the default database domain file in
~/GNUstep/Defaults/WindowMaker, and let Window Maker refresh the screen.
Please note that this option only works under Window Maker, and will have no
effect under other window managers, since it rely on Window Maker to update
the image after it reads the updated defaults database.</p></li>
<li><p><span class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">-D</span></span> - &lt;domain&gt; is same as above, but will update the domain &lt;domain&gt;
instead of the default Window Maker domain.</p></li>
<li><p><span class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">-c</span></span> &lt;cpc&gt; will set the color per channel to use. Only needed for
PseudoColor visuals. Window Maker will automatically pass the value read from
the Window Maker domain database.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The following line is straight from your WindowMaker-0.15.x
~/GNUstep/Library/WindowMaker/menu file and should all be on one line.</p>
<p>"Images" OPEN_MENU BACKGROUNDS_DIR ~/GNUstep/Library/WindowMaker/Backgrounds
WITH wmsetbg -u -t</p>
<p>This should give you an idea on how to add other entries for different image
directories. See the help info at the top of the
~/GNUstep/Library/WindowMaker/menu file for more information.</p>
<p>If you for some reason would like to set your background image with XV, for
instance to use an image format not yet supported by wmsetbg or to use one of
XV's special modes, edit the file ~/GNUstep/Library/WindowMaker/autostart and
insert the line</p>
<pre class="code sh highlight literal-block"><code>xv -root -quit -maxpect ~/background.jpg</code></pre>
<p>or</p>
<pre class="code sh highlight literal-block"><code>xv -root -quit -max ~/background.jpg</code></pre>

(where X is a number 1-9 I believe):</p>
<pre class="code sh highlight literal-block"><code>xv -root -quit -rmodeX ~/background.jpg</code></pre>
<p>If you would like xv functionality in your menu, heres a nice little tip from

<h2>
<span class="sectnum">3.19</span> How do I add dynamic items to my root menu?</h2>
<p>A few programs are floating about, notably wkdemenu.pl that can produce output
from other menu styles. In order to get WindowMaker to launch the process
everytime you want to use the menu, use something like</p>
<pre class="code highlight literal-block"><code>("External Menu", OPEN_MENU, "| bob.sh")</code></pre>
<p>in a proplist style menu. You can tell if you have a proplist style menu if you
can edit it with WPrefs.</p>
<p>You can do this directly in WPrefs by going to the menu editor, adding an
"external menu", and then clicking the "ask guru button" and filling in the
process name.</p>

<section id="how-do-i-remove-or-hide-appicons">
<h2>
<span class="sectnum">3.20</span> How do I remove or hide appicons?</h2>
<p>There are two options here, and you need to consider which one you prefer. Read
both of these before you decide.</p>
<p>First, if you do not want to use the clip or dock at all, you can launch wmaker
with with</p>
<pre class="code shell-session highlight literal-block"><code><span class="gp">$ </span>wmaker --no-clip --no-dock</code></pre>
<p>and then in <span class="docutils literal">~/GNUstep/Defaults/WMWindowAttributes</span> add</p>
<pre class="code highlight literal-block"><code>"*" = {NoAppIcon=Yes;};</code></pre>
<p>The problem with this method is if you use the dock for dockapps, it renders
them with out an appicon to write to. An alternative method if you are willing
to let the clip be on your desktop is to right click on the clip &gt; clip options
&gt; auto attract. Double click the clip so that it is grayed and all appicons
will be hidden. Then you can hide the clip behind the dock so that it is out of
your way. This will allow appicons to work.</p>

<p>Thanks to  Jim Knoble for this answer</p>
<p>Set the focus to the window and then use the keystroke assigned to the titlebar
menu. If you're not sure what the keystroke is, you can find out using WPrefs:
in the keyboard section, select the <em>Open window commands menu</em> item in the
list of actions. The keystroke assigned to it ought to appear in the
<em>Shortcut' area</em>.</p>
<p>Typically it is Control-Esc or F10 in older version of WindowMaker.</p>

<h2>
<span class="sectnum">3.22</span> How do I remove ALT+Mouse1 from the action Window Maker grabs for an application?</h2>
<p>Do [Button3Down] (for righthanded mouse users, [RightButtonDown]) on the

<p>The result is that [Alt+Button1] (which usually grabs a window to move it
around), [Alt+Button2] (which usually grabs a window to move it around without
changing the window stacking order), and [Alt+Button3] (which usually resizes a
window) all get passed to the application instead of performing their usual

<h2>
<span class="sectnum">3.23</span> How do I configure the Dock and Clip to use less space on a small screen?</h2>
<p>This answer is current as of WindowMaker-0.61.1.</p>
<p>For the Clip, either:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Disable the Clip from WPrefs (panel number 7), or</p></li>
<li><p>Hide the Clip under the Dock (for example, in the upper righth and corner of
the screen).</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The latter is probably more useful on desktops with limited space, since you
can still set the Clip to attract app-icons so they don't clutter your desktop.</p>
<p>For the Dock, try the following:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>Exit Window Maker.</p></li>
<li><p>Log in via a text console or using a different window manager.</p></li>
<li><p>Edit ~/GNUstep/Defaults/WMState using your favorite text editor
(for example, vi, emacs, or pico).</p></li>
<li><p>Find the <em>Applications</em> part of the <em>Dock</em> structure. Find the item with
<em>Position = "0,0";</em>. Change the <em>Command</em> item to the command you want the
top tile to launch. Change the <em>Name</em> item to the <em>&lt;instance&gt;.&lt;class&gt;</em> name
of the application you just made the Command item start (for example, if
<em>Command</em> is <em>"xedit"</em>, then <em>Name</em> should be <em>xedit.Xedit</em>).</p></li>
<li><p>Save the WMState file.</p></li>
<li><p>Start an X session with Window Maker.</p></li>
<li><p>Check that the top tile starts the command you told it to. (You should still
also be able to move the Dock up and down using [LeftDrag] on the top tile.)</p></li>
<li><p>You can configure the tile (including autolaunch and the drop-command) in
the regular manner ([RightButtonDown] on the tile and choose <em>Settings...</em>
from the resulting menu).</p></li>

<h2>
<span class="sectnum">4.2</span> What is the difference between the Exit and Exit Session Option?</h2>
<p>Another answer from Dan Pascu:</p>
<p>Exit will exit wmaker, but can leave other X apps running, provided that it was
not the last app launched in the .xinitrc (for instance, if you had exec
wmaker, followed by exec xterm, exiting wmaker using 'Exit' will leave the
xterm running so you could start another window manager, etc.)  This is
accomplished because X will not shutdown unless all X apps are closed.</p>
<p>Exit session will exit wmaker, but will also close all running apps, thus the X
server will be closed too.</p>

<p>If the program is not running, just drag the icon to the middle of your desktop

icon off the dock.</p>
<p>I docked an application but when I run it the button is permanently shaded and
I can't run new instances. You probably docked the application with dockit. To
fix it remove the icon and use the "Emulate Application Icon" checkbox in the
Advanced Options section of the Attributes panel for the window. Then restart
the application to get the application icon you must use to dock the
application. It can also mean that you did something you shouldn't, which is
changing the program that is ran from the docked icon. For example, if you
docked rxvt you must NOT change it to xterm, for example. You also can't do any
changes that might alter the contents of the WM_CLASS hint for the window, like
the -name parameter for xterm, rxvt and other programs.</p>

<!-- TODO give complete explanation -->
<p>When I set the root background with wmsetbg by hand it works, but when I do

with wmsetbg by hand, it will obviously find the image, since you have
explicitly specified it by hand. But if you simply put it in
<span class="docutils literal">~/GNUstep/Defaults/WindowMaker</span> in some option like WorkspaceBack, it will
not find the image because Window Maker can't read your mind to figure where
you put the image. So, to fix it, you have to either place the full path for
the image in the texture specification or put the path for the directory you
put your background images in the PixmapPath option. You can also put all your
background images in places like <span class="docutils literal">~/GNUstep/Library/WindowMaker/Backgrounds</span>
or <span class="docutils literal">/usr/local/share/WindowMaker/Backgrounds</span>.</p>
<p>David Green says that another possibility is that you have two copies of the

<p>If you refer to the problem of the "graphics" window of scilab not showing up

the problem by yourself, by running xprop on the graphic window:
WM_NORMAL_HINTS(WM_SIZE_HINTS):</p>

told, that is, map the window at position 136679205, 1074468360 which obviously
falls outside the screen no matter how big is your monitor ;)</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the workaround for this is to open the window list menu (click on
the root window with the middle mouse button) and click on the ScilabGraphic

commands menu (right click on window's titlebar) and open the Attributes panel.

<section id="how-do-i-dock-an-arbitrary-console-application-like-mutt">
<h2>
<span class="sectnum">5.12</span> How do I dock an arbitrary console application like mutt?</h2>
<p>There are two key things to do if you want a program (such as mutt) to be able
to start in a terminal window from the Dock or the Clip:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Make the terminal window start the program you want to run instead of a
shell. Both xterm and rxvt (and its descendants) are capable of doing this.
For example:</p>
<pre class="code shell-session highlight literal-block"><code><span class="go">xterm -e mutt
rxvt -e mutt
gnome-terminal -e mutt</span></code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p>Convince Window Maker that the resulting terminal window is not a regular
terminal window, but rather some other program instance. Both xterm and rxvt
are also capable of doing this.  Make sure that -e is the last command
option. For example:</p>
<pre class="code shell-session highlight literal-block"><code><span class="go">xterm -name muttTerm -e mutt
rxvt -name muttTerm -e mutt
gnome-terminal --name=muttTerm -e mutt</span></code></pre>
<p>This causes the instance of the terminal window that you start to have an
&lt;instance-name&gt;.&lt;class-name&gt; pair of <span class="docutils literal">muttTerm.XTerm</span> (usually rxvt's
class is also XTerm; don't know about its descendants, such as wterm and
Eterm).</p>
<p>Do not use spaces or periods in the instance name. For example, these are
BAD instance names:</p>
<pre class="code shell-session highlight literal-block"><code><span class="go">xterm -name mutt.term -e mutt
rxvt -name 'mutt term' -e mutt</span></code></pre>
<p>Window Maker will not like you if you use them.</p>
<p>With a different instance name, you can now do the following:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Dock the resulting appicon in the dock, or clip it to the Clip.</p></li>
<li><p>Assign a different icon and different window properties to the <cite>special'
terminal window running your program (make sure you choose the exact
``muttTerm.XTerm`</cite> window specification in the Attributes editor).</p></li>
<li><p>Specify different resource settings for muttTerm in your ~/.Xdefaults file
(e.g., different default foreground and background colors).</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>There are a few other non-key things you can do to complete the process:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Tell the terminal window to display a more meaningful or prettier title and
icon title than what gets put there due to <span class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">-e</span></span>. For example:</p>
<pre class="code shell-session highlight literal-block"><code><span class="go">rxvt -title 'Mail (mutt)' -n 'Mail' -name muttTerm -e mutt</span></code></pre>
<p>Xterm works the same way.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>These are getting to be a lot of command-line options. Make a wrapper script
to use so you don't have to remember them all:</p>
<pre class="code shell-session highlight literal-block"><code><span class="go">mkdir ~/bin
cat &gt;~/bin/muttTerm &lt;&lt;EOF
</span><span class="gp">#</span>!/bin/sh
<span class="go">rxvt -title 'Mail (mutt)' -n 'Mail' -name muttTerm -e mutt
EOF
chmod +x ~/bin/muttTerm</span></code></pre>
<p>Now you can do the same thing as that really long command in [3] above using
the simple:</p>
<pre class="code shell-session highlight literal-block"><code><span class="go">~/bin/muttTerm</span></code></pre>
<p>If you put ~/bin in your PATH, you can use the even simpler:</p>
<pre class="code shell-session highlight literal-block"><code><span class="go">muttTerm</span></code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you want to be sly, you can change the docked muttTerm to use your new
wrapper script instead of the really long command; then, when you want to
change anything in the really long command except for the instance name, you
can just change the wrapper script, and it's done. Here's the procedure:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>[RightButtonDown] on the muttTerm dock tile</p></li>
<li><p>Choose <span class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Settings...</span></span></p></li>
<li><p>Replace the text in the <span class="docutils literal">Application path and arguments</span> field with the following:</p></li>
</ul>
<pre class="code highlight literal-block"><code>muttTerm</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Choose <span class="docutils literal">OK</span></p>
<p>Note that Window Maker needs to know that ~/bin is on your PATH for this to
work; you may need to exit your X session and start it again.</p>
<p>To change the instance name of the terminal window (e.g., from <span class="docutils literal">muttTerm</span>
to <span class="docutils literal">mailTerm</span> or <span class="docutils literal">blah</span> or <span class="docutils literal">terminalWindowRunningMutt</span>), you need to
do the following</p>
</li>
<li><p>Change your muttTerm script</p></li>
<li><p>Undock your old muttTerm</p></li>
<li><p>Run your muttTerm script</p></li>
<li><p>Dock the resulting terminal window</p></li>
<li><p>Do the stuff in first 4 subpoint above again.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Good luck.</p>

<h2>
<span class="sectnum">5.14</span> How can I dock an application from a remote machine using ssh?</h2>
<p>This answer asumes that you have already set up RSA authentication using
<span class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">ssh-keygen</span></span>. To be able to launch applications without being prompted for
the password, you can use <span class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">ssh-agent</span></span> and <span class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">ssh-add</span></span> as follows.</p>
<p>With the addition to ~/.xsession of</p>
<pre class="code shell-session highlight literal-block"><code><span class="go">eval `ssh-agent`
ssh-add /dev/null</span></code></pre>
<p>just before</p>
<pre class="code shell-session highlight literal-block"><code><span class="go">exec wmaker</span></code></pre>
<p>Then ssh will no longer prompt for the RSA-key passphrase. The <span class="docutils literal">/dev/null</span>
argument to <span class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">ssh-add</span></span> causes it to use the <span class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">ssh-askpass</span></span> graphical dialog.</p>
<p>The following procedure shows how to dock a remote xterm using <span class="docutils literal">ssh</span>.  This
procedure should work well for any well-behaved X11 application, including most
Dock applets.</p>
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>From a terminal window, start an ssh session with <span class="docutils literal">xterm</span> as the command:</p>
<pre class="code shell-session highlight literal-block"><code><span class="go">ssh -a -C -X remote.example.net "xterm -name blah"</span></code></pre>
<p>(The '-a' switch turns off agent forwarding, for security reasins and the
'-X' switch turns on X11 forwarding, required for the remote xterm to run.
The -C option turns on compression, very useful for things such as X)</p>
</li>
<li><p>When the remote xterm appears, find the appicon. If it's not already in the
Clip, drag it there.</p></li>
<li>
<p>[RightButtonDown] on the appicon and choose 'Settings...' from the menu.
Note that the 'Application path and arguments' field contains only:</p>
<pre class="code shell-session highlight literal-block"><code><span class="go">xterm -name blah</span></code></pre>
<p>Change that to:</p>
<pre class="code shell-session highlight literal-block"><code><span class="go">ssh -a -C -X remote.example.net "xterm -name blah"</span></code></pre>
<p>The backslashes and double quotes are critical. Change the contents of
'Command for files dropped with DND' in the same fashion, putting '%d'
inside the double quotes.</p>
<p>If you wish, change the icon so that you can recognize the tile easily.
Press 'OK'.</p>
</li>
<li><p>[RightButtonDown] on the appicon again and choose 'Keep Icon(s)'.</p></li>
<li><p>Exit the remote xterm. The new Clip tile should remain, with the three dots
at the lower lefthand corner to indicate the app is no longer running.</p></li>
<li><p>[DoubleClick] on the new Clip tile.  You should get the remote xterm again
after a short while, depending on the speed of your network and of the
remote machine.</p></li>
<li><p>You may either leave the remote application in the Clip, or drag it to the
Dock.</p></li>
</ol>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>You should be wary of docking something like <span class="docutils literal">wminet</span> or <span class="docutils literal">wmnet</span> in the
manner, since you may create a feedback loop by causing additional network
traffic, which the program monitors, causing yet more network traffic...</p>

<h2>
<span class="sectnum">5.15</span> How do you make an omnipresent window not take focus whenever switching workspaces?</h2>
<p>Typically, on applications like xmms, they are set to omnipresent so they will
appear on every workspace. This causes the app to often get the focus
unintentionally when switching workspaces.</p>
<p>To remedy this,</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>Bring up the <span class="docutils literal">Attributes</span> menu. You can do this by [Right Clicking] on the
title bar and seletcing <span class="docutils literal">Attributes</span>. Alternatively, you may hit
'Control+ESC' at the same time to bring up the title bar menu on apps that
do not have a title bar.</p></li>

<span class="sectnum">6.4</span> How do I make a Theme?</h2>
<p>Please see the <a class="reference external" href="/themes/themepacks.html">theme-HOWTO</a> for
details on making both new and old style themes (and the differences between
the two), here is a short summary on making old style themes. Also, read the
README.themes file included with the Window Maker distribution in the
WindowMaker/ directory.</p>
<p>In this walk-through when I use WindowMaker/, it can refer to the global
/usr/local/share/WindowMaker/ directory or the users own
~/GNUstep/Library/WindowMaker/ directory.</p>
<p>To make a Theme.tar.gz, these are the steps I take:</p>
<ol class="arabic">
<li><p>Optionally create a README for your theme in WindowMaker/, call it
something like "ThemeName.txt"</p></li>
<li>
<p>Use the following command to add the Theme files to your .tar file.</p>
<pre class="code shell-session highlight literal-block"><code><span class="go">tar cvf ThemeName.tar ThemeName.txt Themes/ThemeName
Backgrounds/ThemeNameBG.jpg Backgrounds/ThemeNameTile.xpm</span></code></pre>
<p>You can add as many more images as you need from the appropriate directories
nder WindowMaker/ following that general idea. You can even optionally add
an IconSets/ThemeName.iconset and it's associated icons to your theme in the
same manner. This should be stated in your README if you decide to include
these.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Then gzip your .tar file to make your ThemeName.tar.gz file with this
command:</p>
<pre class="code shell-session highlight literal-block"><code><span class="go">tar cvf ThemeName.tar ThemeName.txt Themes/ThemeName
Backgrounds/ThemeNameBG.jpg Backgrounds/ThemeNameTile.xpm</span></code></pre>
<p>You can add as many more images as you need from the appropriate directories</p>
<pre class="code shell-session highlight literal-block"><code><span class="go">gzip -9 ThemeName.tar</span></code></pre>

<h2>
<span class="sectnum">7.1</span> Is there a pager for Window Maker?</h2>
<p>Not at the moment because there is not a pressing need for a pager. The concept
of multiple desktops does exist and there are currently 3 ways to switch
between them.</p>
<p>First, the Meta+Number combination will switch between desktops. The Workspaces
menu will also let you switch workspaces. Lastly, the clip will also scroll one
through workspaces.  For those that would like to send an application to a
specific workspace, either drag it to the edge of the desktop onto the next
workspace, or right click on its title bar, select 'Move To', and click the
workspace you want it to be moved to.</p>
<p>However, Window Maker does support KDE and GNOME protocols, including their
workspace management, so you may use their pager in conjunction with Window
Maker in these.  Note that in order for this to work, you must enable support
when you configure Window Maker (using the --enable-kde and --enable-gnome
configure options).</p>
<p>Note also that the Blackbox pager application will work with Window Maker.</p>

<span class="sectnum">7.3</span> Why was libPropList removed from the distribution?</h2>
<p>Alfredo Kojima writes:</p>
<p>libPropList was removed from Window Maker because other programs also use it,
such as GNOME.  If libPropList is distributed with wmaker, it would cause
problems with whatever version of libPropList you already had installed.</p>
<p>Now, there is no more GNOME libproplist and Window Maker libproplist. There is
only libPropList which is worked on as a single community effort.</p>

<section id="why-don-t-you-distribute-normal-diff-or-xdelta-patches">
<h2>
<span class="sectnum">7.4</span> Why don't you distribute normal diff or xdelta patches?</h2>
<p>Whenever possible, plain diff patches are distributed. If the new version has
new binary files, normal diff won't be able to handle them, so a patch package
is distributed instead. We don't use xdelta because a) most systems do not have
xdelta installed and b) xdelta is picky and requires the files to be patched to
be exactly the same as the one used to make the patch.  The patch package
scheme used is much more flexible.</p>
<p>We do not distribute a simple diff with the binary files separately (and
variations, like uuencoding the binary files) because a) it is more complicated
and error prone to require the user to manually move the files to the correct
places  b) the current patch package scheme <em>does</em> distribute the binary files
and diff files separately. If the user wants to install everything by hand,
nobody will object to that and c) sooner or later someone will certainly ask
for a script to automate the file moving stuff.</p>
<p>So we hacked a script (mkpatch) that automatically creates a patch package with
the normal text diff file, a list of removed files and the binary files that
have changed or been added, plus a script that does the patching automatically.
If you don't like the script, you can apply the patch and move the files
manually. Or download the whole distribution.</p>

<h2>
<span class="sectnum">7.6</span> How can I produce a backtrace when Window Maker keeps crashing?</h2>
<p>Thanks to Paul Seelig for this answer:</p>
<p>You can use the GNU debugger "gdb" to get exact information about how and where
wmaker crashed.  Sending this information to the developers is the most
convenient way to help in debugging.</p>
<p>The wmaker binary needs to be compiled with debugging turned on ("./configure
--with-debug etc.") for this to work.</p>
<p>Exit wmaker and start a failsafe X session with an open xterm.</p>
<p>First type the command "script" to log the following session into a file
commonly called "~/typescript".  Then enter "gdb wmaker" at the shellprompt:</p>
<pre class="code shell-session highlight literal-block"><code><span class="go">[shell prompt]~ &gt; script

<p>At the gdb prompt simply type "run" to start the WMaker session:</p>
<pre class="code highlight literal-block"><code>(gdb) run
Starting program: /usr/bin/X11/wmaker</code></pre>
<p>Try to reproduce the error which has provoked the crash before and if you
succeed the session will simply freeze and you will see something similiar to
following prompt:</p>
<pre class="code highlight literal-block"><code>Program received signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault.

<p>Another insightful answer from who else but Dan Pascu.</p>
<p>You must define the WM_CLASS (XSetClassHint()) and the CLIENT_LEADER or
XWMHints.window_group properties, which are automatically set by most
applications that use Xt (Motif, Athena ...), but if you use plain Xlib you
must set them by hand.</p>
<p>Also you must make a call to XSetCommand(dpy, leader, argv, argc);</p>
<p>Take a look at WindowMaker-0.12.3/test/test.c that is an example for writing
such an app (which also have an app menu).</p>
