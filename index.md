Introduction
============

**Window Maker** is an X11 [window
manager](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Window_manager) originally designed to
provide integration support for the [GNUstep](http://gnustep.org) Desktop
Environment, although it can run stand alone. In every way possible, it
reproduces the elegant look and feel of the
[NeXTSTEP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NeXTSTEP) user interface.
