Community
=========

There are couple of ways, how to reach Window Maker community.

Mailing Lists
-------------

Mailing lists are main point of contact, especially for development group which
is quite small, and often tend to be pretty quiet for couple of weeks.

Listed below are the currently available Window Maker mailing lists. We have
switched our list over to [Google Groups](https://groups.google.com).

### Window Maker Developer List

The Window Maker developer list is aimed at developers and others interested in
the inner workings of Window Maker.

* Email: <wmaker-dev@googlegroups.com>
* Pre-Google Groups archive:

### Window Maker User List

The Window Maker user list is aimed at the end user for questions, tips,
suggestions and general discussion.

### Subscribe/Unsubscribe

Please see the [Google Groups
documentation](https://support.google.com/groups/?hl=en#topic=2458613).

### Etiquette

The following rules of etiquette are to be followed when posting to any of the
lists:

* Do not [top post](http://www.idallen.com/topposting.html).
* Use of excessive quoting in E-mail replies is frowned upon.
* HTML messages and non-text attachments will be rejected.
* Please consider reading some of our [documentation]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs)
  before posting questions to the lists.  The Window Maker source code comes
  with a README, INSTALL, and NEWS file. There is also a
  [FAQ]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/FAQ.html) to read.
* Please, please, and pretty please **THINK** before you post. Try very hard not
  to intentionally provoke others and cause flame-wars. We reserve the right to
  unsubscribe and ban any user that has a history of causing trouble.
