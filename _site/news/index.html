procedures now have a more intuitive behavior with respect to remembering the
old geometry and going back to it. Furthermore, there are some other small
fixes and cleanups.</p>

<p>Window Maker 0.95.2 was released on February 14th 2012, and it contains just a
few commits on top of 0.95.1. They were necessary to fix a few issues like
‘make dist’ not compiling. Furthermore a few more code cleanups slipped in.</p>

version 0.95.1 contains many bug fixes and also a few new features.</p>

<h3 id="new-features-and-highlights">New features and highlights</h3>

<p>The following list is incomplete, but should give a first-order approximation
to the new features in this release. For the truly curious among you, reading
through <code class="highlighter-rouge">git log</code> is the only complete source of information.</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://repo.or.cz/w/wmaker-crm.git/commit/6924454">Left Half/Right Half
Maximize</a>.</li>
  <li><a href="http://repo.or.cz/w/wmaker-crm.git/commit/cf62d15">Maximus: tiled
maximization</a>.
Maximizes a window such that it occupies the largest area without overlapping
others.</li>
  <li><a href="http://repo.or.cz/w/wmaker-crm.git/commit/a063338">New mouse-resizing
functionality</a>.
Windows can now be resized vertically (horizontally) using MOD+Wheel
(CTRL+Wheel).</li>
  <li><a href="http://repo.or.cz/w/wmaker-crm.git/commit/05720d9">History and TAB completion in
dialogs</a>. To use this new
functionality in your old WMRootMenu, replace %a by %A in the relevant entry.
It will look like this <code class="highlighter-rouge">(Run..., SHEXEC, "%A(Run, Type command:)")</code>. Or use
<code class="highlighter-rouge">wmgenmenu</code> to generate a new menu.</li>
  <li><a href="http://repo.or.cz/w/wmaker-crm.git/commit/a257e16">Bouncing appicon effect</a>.</li>
  <li>New applications
(<a href="http://repo.or.cz/w/wmaker-crm.git/commit/1861880">wmgenmenu</a> and wmmenugen)
to generate the root menu automatically by looking which applications you have
on your $PATH. Translations to German, <a href="http://repo.or.cz/w/wmaker-crm.git/commit/077a2ea">Spanish and
French</a> of menus generated
by wmgenmenu.</li>
  <li><a href="http://repo.or.cz/w/wmaker-crm.git/commit/56d8568">Automatic detection of configuration
changes</a>. Linux users whose
kernel supports the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inotify">inotify</a> mechanism
have their configuration changes detected automatically without polling,
reducing the number of CPU wakeups.</li>
  <li><a href="http://repo.or.cz/w/wmaker-crm.git/commit/9318a7f">Improved dockapp
recognition.</a></li>
  <li>And many trivial things which reduce little annoyances one might have. For
example, an option was added to control whether or not Window Maker should do
<a href="http://repo.or.cz/w/wmaker-crm.git/commit/d6c134f">automatic workspace
switching</a> to satisfy a
focus request from a window located in another workspace.</li>
  <li>(For developers).
The <a href="http://repo.or.cz/w/wmaker-crm.git/commit/442e387">addition</a> of a debian/
folder which allows the creation of a debian package for wmaker using the git
sources.</li>
  <li><a href="http://repo.or.cz/w/wmaker-crm.git/commit/b6689a0">Added keyboard shortcut to uncover/cover the
dock</a>.</li>
  <li><a href="http://repo.or.cz/w/wmaker-crm.git/commit/18408ff">Mac OS X-style window
cycling</a>.</li>
  <li><a href="http://repo.or.cz/w/wmaker-crm.git/commit/c201e16">Preliminary XRandR
support</a> (needs a bit more
work to be bug-free; not compiled in by default. Use –enable-xrandr if you
want to test it).</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="bug-fixes">Bug fixes</h3>

<p>Window Maker 0.92.0 was already very stable, but many bugs were fixed in this
release. A <strong>very</strong> incomplete list is given below, and as time permits it will
be updated (including links to the commits) in the future. But the message now
is that if you don’t like bugs, use version 0.95.1.</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://repo.or.cz/w/wmaker-crm.git/commit/37829a7">Fix loading saved states on 64-bit
systems</a></li>
  <li>Fix to avoid a segfault when creating more than 81 workspaces, as reported on
youtube <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fkNJZvKwmhE">here</a>.</li>
  <li><a href="http://repo.or.cz/w/wmaker-crm.git/commit/c91bb1b">Periodic focus bug</a>.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="summary-of-changes">Summary of changes</h3>

<p>A lot of effort was put into cleaning up the code, with lots of code removal and
tidying things up. The following output should give you an idea of the
development in the last cycle:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>git diff --shortstat wmaker-0.92.0+..wmaker-0.95.1
 592 files changed, 118361 insertions(+), 133342 deletions(-)
git diff --shortstat 688a56e8ab67b..wmaker-0.95.1
 566 files changed, 37676 insertions(+), 41817 deletions(-)
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The first shortstat is really everything, including the (huge) patch generated
in this <a href="http://repo.or.cz/w/wmaker-crm.git/commit/688a56e">commit</a> from 2009,
which changed the old sources to the linux kernel coding style. The second
shortstat contains the summary of development afterwards – but included is the
addition of a debian folder with files summing around ~20k lines. The full
diffstat for the second command can be seen <a href="fulldiffstat.html">here</a>.</p>
